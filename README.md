# Spartans Market Town Backend Core Jave Project
## Problem Statement
My website solves the shopping experience problem of other existing mall websites. Most of the existing Mall websites look like brand advertisements. On my website, the customer will also be able to see what are the products available in the specific shop in the mall, what are their new arrivals, and help customers buy something that they are looking for which is very specific. This is something I have not seen on other mall websites. All the products can also be delivered at home by placing the order through the website.

## About this repo:
This repository contains the backend code for the SpartansMt web application. The frontend development is handled separately in the following repository: [Link to Frontend Repository](https://github.com/fssa-batch3/mathankumar.nagarajan__web_project)

The backend is developed using Core Java and integrated with an SQL database for data storage.

## Project Structure

The core components of the backend are organized as follows:

- [src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/model:](https://github.com/fssa-batch3/sec_c_mathankumar.nagarajan__corejava_project_2/tree/main/src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/model) This directory contains the model classes representing the objects.

- [src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/validator:](https://github.com/fssa-batch3/sec_c_mathankumar.nagarajan__corejava_project_2/tree/main/src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/validator) This directory contains the validation classes to validate the model classes.

- [src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/service:](https://github.com/fssa-batch3/sec_c_mathankumar.nagarajan__corejava_project_2/tree/main/src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/service) This directory contains service classes that implement business logic for the SpartansMT web application.

- [src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/dao:](https://github.com/fssa-batch3/sec_c_mathankumar.nagarajan__corejava_project_2/tree/main/src/main/java/com/fssa/spartansmt/dao) The Data Access Object (DAO) classes are stored in this directory. The DAO classes handle interactions with the database and provide methods for CRUD operations.

- [src/test/java/com/fssa/spartansmt:](https://github.com/fssa-batch3/sec_c_mathankumar.nagarajan__corejava_project_2/tree/main/src/test/java/com/fssa/spartansmt) This directory contains unit test cases for the SpartansMT backend.
